# Increasing Root Partition Disk Space in Ubuntu

To increase the disk space of your root partition in Ubuntu, you will need to use a tool called GParted.  

## Getting GParted
First, you will need to boot from a live USB or DVD that contains GParted. You can download a live version of Ubuntu that includes GParted from the following link:

## Steps
Once you have a live version of Ubuntu with GParted, follow these steps:  

1. Insert the live USB or DVD into your computer and restart it.  
2. Press the appropriate key to enter the boot menu. This key may be different for different computers. Some common keys include F12, F10, and Esc.  
3. Select the option to boot from the live USB or DVD.  
4. When the live version of Ubuntu boots up, open GParted from the Applications menu.  
5. In GParted, select the partition that you want to increase the size of, and then click the "Resize/Move" button.  
6. In the "Resize/Move" window, increase the size of the partition by dragging the right side of the partition to the right.  
7. Click the "Resize/Move" button to apply the changes.  
8. Click the "Apply All Operations" button to apply all of the pending operations.  
9. Once the operations are complete, you should now have more disk space on your root partition.  

**Note:** It is important to be careful when using GParted as it can cause data loss if used improperly. It is always a good idea to make a backup of your important data before making any changes to your partitions.
